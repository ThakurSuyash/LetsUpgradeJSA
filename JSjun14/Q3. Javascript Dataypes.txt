Javascript Data types are as follows:

There are six basic data types in Javascript which can be further divided into three categories.
1.Primitive-String,Number,Boolean
2.Composite-Object,Array,Function
3.Special -Undefined,null

Some of data types are as follows:
  A.String data type:
  Eg.var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
  1.In this the string data type is used to represent textual data.
  2.Single or double quotes can be used.
  
  B.Number data type:
  The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).
  
  C.Boolean data type:
  The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:
 
  D.Object data type:The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
  
  E.Array data type:
  An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].
  
  F.Function data type:
  The function is callable object that executes a block of code.
  functions can be used at any place any other value can be used. 
  Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays.
  Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, and functions can be returned from functions.
